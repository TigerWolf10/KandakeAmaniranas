            <p>Amanirenas was a brave, strong one-eyed queen of Kush who ruled from approximately 40 BC to 10 BC. Amanirenas, who was a famous 'Kandake', which essentially means 'queen'. She ruled during the Meroitic period, a culture developed that from the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of ancient Egypt originating in Kush - located in the kingdom of Nubia in the place now known as Sudan. During her reign, she managed to do what others before her had failed at; driving out the Romans that had conquered Egypt at the time.

            <p>She commanded an army of around 30000 soldiers and utilised the element of surprise to launch their first attack. They waited until Aelius Gallus, the Prefect at the time, was away on a campaign before springing into action. The Kushites captured two major Roman cities, Syene and Philae, they took captives and expanded their borders. However, the next year, they were driven out of Syene by a new Roman Prefect called Gaius Petronius</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>The Kushites waged war with the Romans once more, but this time, Petronius was better prepared when Kandake Amanirenas and her forces attempted to seize Primis. The Kushites failed in their attack, however instead of fighting the two parties started to negotiate. Eventually, they reached an agreement that benefitted both parties and a peace treaty was signed around 21/20 B.C. The Romans left Primis and the Meroites were exempted from having to pay tribute to the Emperor as a result of this deal. Kandake Amanirenas’ fight with the Romans lasted five years and resulted in an era of peace between the Romans and the Kush. Her resilience and courage forced the Romans to reconsider their situation and re-evaluate their position in the region.
